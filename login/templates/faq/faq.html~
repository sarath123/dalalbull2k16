<h3><a name="p0">What Are Common Stocks?</h3>
<p>Common stock is a way for individuals to own a portion of a publicly traded company. It is referred to as â€œcommonâ€ to differentiate it from preferred stock. This is significant in case of a bankruptcy, as common stock is paid out last, after preferred stock holders, bondholders and creditors. Common stockholders have voting rights unlike preferred stockholders.</br>
</p>
<h3><a name="p1">What Are Penny Stocks?</h3>
<p>Penny stocks are sub $1.00 stocks that are extremely high risk. They are usually stocks with no earnings and quarter after quarter they lose money. These companies trade around $1.00 for the obvious reasons, poor fundamentals and a lack of clarity on their future. Bankruptcy is always possible as they continue to lose money. While extremely high risk, penny stocks do offer the potential for huge gains.</br></p>
<h3><a name="p2">What Are Dividend Stocks?</h3>
<p>Dividend paying stocks are usually older, stable companies that have a strong track record of earnings. Once long term earnings has been established, a company will often declare a dividend, giving some profits back to its investors. A dividend is paid to its shareholders in quarterly installment. Investors like these stocks because they are known to be generally safer.</br><p>
<h3><a name="p3">What Is A Cyclical Stock?</h3>
<p>Cyclical stocks are ones that rises and falls with the business cycle in a predictable manner- majority of this is due to the buying patterns of people and industries based on the overall state of the economy. For example, hotel chains and retail stores are two prime industries that are considered â€œcyclical stocksâ€. When the economy is up, people are more likely to travel and shop, and conversely, when the economy is not doing as well, these luxuries tend to be the first to go.</br></p>
<h3><a name="p4">What is Swing Trading?</h3>
<p>Swing trading is the technique of buying and selling stocks, currencies or commodities, holding the position for days or weeks then getting rid of them for a profit. A good swing trader never falls in love with a stock, instead using it as a vehicle to profit from. A swing trader looks to maximize gains through playing the wild swings in anything they can trade.</br></p>
<h3><a name="p5">What is short selling?</h3>
<p>Short selling is the practice of selling shares that have been borrowed from a third party with the intention of buying identical shares back at a later date to return to the lender. The short seller hopes to profit from a decline in the value of the shares between the sale and the repurchase, as he will pay less to buy the shares than he received on selling them. At Dalal Bull you need not worry about the third party. Short sell at a high price and gain profit by repurchasing (SHORT COVER) when the value decline.</br></p>
<h3><a name="p6">What is Day Trading?</h3>
<p>Day trading is a strategy employed by traders who attempt to make a living by going long and short any market or stock for very short periods. As a day trade implies, the trader will get rid of the position the very same day they go long or short. Day trades usually last seconds or minutes. A great day trader will go long or short a stock, market, commodity or currency for seconds, making hundreds if not thousands in profit. Anyone can be a day trader but there is high risk involved.</br></p>
<h3><a name="p7">Why Invest In The Stock Market?</h3>
<p>Investing in the stock market is important for people that wish to build a healthy financial future. The main reason for investing in stocks is to make money. There are many ways you can invest but the stock market usually offers the highest returns investing wisely in the stock market is the only way to ensure a successful, unstressed future.

<h3><a name="p10">What is a dividend?</a></h3>
<p>A sum of money paid regularly (typically quarterly) by a company to its shareholders out of its profits (or reserves).The dividend is most often quoted in terms of the Rupee amount each share receives (dividends per share). </br>If a company announces 50% dividend and the facevalue of the company is Rs.2, the shareholders will get Rs.1 for each share.

<h3><a name="p11">What is pig market?</h3>
<p>An investor who is often seen as greedy, having forgotten his or her original investment strategy to focus on securing unrealistic future gains. After experiencing a gain, these investors often have very high expectations about the future prospects of the investment and, therefore, do not sell their position to realize the gain.</br></p>
<h3><a name="p12">What is  bear market?</h3>
<p>A market condition in which the prices of securities are falling, and widespread pessimism causes the negative sentiment to be self-sustaining. As investors anticipate losses in a bear market and selling continues, pessimism only grows.</br></p>
<h3><a name="p13">What is bull market?</h3>
<p>A financial market of a group of securities in which prices are rising or are expected to rise. The term "bull market" is most often used to refer to the stock market, but can be applied to anything that is traded, such as bonds, currencies and commodities.</br></p>
<h3><a name="p14">When will I get the dividend?</h3>
<p>An investor only needs to own the stock for one day (the record date) to be entitled to receive the dividend payment.</br>
