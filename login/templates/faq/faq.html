      <div class="collapsible-body" >
        <p>In simple words, a share or stock is a document issued by a company, which entitles its holder to be one of the owners of the company.Shares are issued by a company or can be purchased from the stock market. By holding a share you are entitled to get dividends from the company profit and by sale of your holdings you get capital gain by the rule of thumb, if the share value at the time of sale is higher than your purchase value.However, you also run a risk of making a capital loss if you have to sell the share at a price below your purchase price.A company's stock price reflects what investors think about the stock, not necessarily what the company is "worth". <br>For example, companies that showcase high growth rate often trade at a price higher than the company's actual worth.Stock prices of specific sector gets affected by all forms of news regarding that sector. Publicly traded companies are required to report quarterly on their financial status and earnings. Market sentiments and general investor opinions can also affect share prices.

      <div class="collapsible-header" style="font-weight:bold">Who is a stock broker ?</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body">
        <p>A Stock Broker is a person or a Firm that trades on its clients' behalf. You tell them where you want to invest in and they will issue the transaction order. You will have to pay brokerage for the service of the broker. Some stock brokers also give out financial advice for which you are charged extra.

      <div class="collapsible-body">
        <p>
          Buy<br>Clear from the term BUY a stock with the money you have....as simple as that<br><br>
          Short Sell<br>
          When an investor goes LONG on an investment, it means he/she has bought a stock believing its price will rise in the future. Conversely, when an investor goes SHORT, he is anticipating a decrease in share price.<br>
          Short selling is selling of a stock that the seller doesn't own. More specifically, a short sale is the sale of a security that isn't owned by the seller, but that is promised to be delivered. That may sound confusing, but it's actually a simple concept.<br><br>
          Still with us? Then lets see more: When you Short Sell a stock, your broker will lend it to you. The stock will come from the broker's own inventory, from another one of the Firm's customers, or from another brokerage Firm. The shares are sold and the proceeds are credited to your account. Sooner or later you must "close" the short by buying back the same number of shares (called Covering) and return them to your broker. If the price drops, you can buy back the stock at the lower price and make a profit on the difference. If the price of the stock rises, you have to buy it back at the higher price, and you lose money.<br><br>
          Limit Trading<br>
          Limit Trading - When you started playing the game you might have  seen the field that says Pending Order, well this is what limit trading is all about. Here you may mention a price at which you want the shares to be bought or sold if you are not happy with the current price. In DALAL BULL, all the pending transactions that has not yet executed will be cancelled automatically when the market closes (i.e. at 15:30). So set the limit which may reach the target before 15.30. You will have to pay brokerage only for the executed transactions. <br><br>
          Pending Price for Buying should be less than and maximum of 5% below Current Price.<br>
          Pending Price for Short Selling should be greater than and maximum of 5% above Current Price

           Sell<br>
           This is all about selling what you bought....thats it!<br><br>
           Short Cover<br>
           This is the process by which you buy back the shares that you already Short sold. First you sell and then you buy (just the opposite of the actual transactions of buying and selling). But the catch is, when the market closes at 15.30, all the shares that you have Short Sold & not Short Covered, will automatically be Short Covered (i.e. bought back).
